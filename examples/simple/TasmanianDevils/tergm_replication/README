where the zip file is extracted into this directory to get the data
files and R script.

This replicates the results in Table 1 of Hamilton et al. (2020) using
the TERGM. Note I had to make some minor changes to the R script to
use the btergm package instead of xergm (xergm is now removed from CRAN
and btergm is used instead), and the non-existent age data, etc.

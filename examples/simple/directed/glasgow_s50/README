Example ALAAM estimation (stochastic approximation) using the 
excerpt of 50 girls from 'Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study' data
from SIENA.

See data at: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/s50_data.htm

The data are used for examples in SIENA, and this example is similar
to the example used in the tutorial for the Bayesian ALAAM implementation
in R here:

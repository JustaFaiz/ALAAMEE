Example estimations using the SocioPatterns high school friendship directed
network from:


	http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/high-school-contact-and-friendship-networks/


	R. Mastrandrea, J. Fournet, A. Barrat, Contact patterns in a high school: a comparison between data collected using wearable sensors, contact diaries and friendship surveys.  PLoS ONE 10(9): e0136497 (2015)


Note that here we are using gender (= male) and school class (= 2BIO3) as
"outcome" binary variables, just to demonstate the meanings of the effects
in the model. Obviusly this is not to be intepreted as social influence
causing the gender to be male or the class to be 2BIO3, it is just a way
of testing the structural positions of actors with those binary attributes.

SocioPatterns High school friendship network and node attributes
("metadata") downloaded from:

http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/high-school-contact-and-friendship-networks/

(release date Jul 15, 2015).

This network is the third dataset listed on that page:

Friendship-network_data_2013.csv.gz
"-The third data set corresponds to the directed network of reported friendships. Each line has the form “i j”, meaning that student i reported a friendship with student j."

metadata_2013.txt
"-Finally the metadata file contains a tab-separated list in which each line of the form “i Ci Gi” gives class Ci and gender Gi of the person having ID i."

The highschool_friendship_arclist.net and highschool_friendship_catattr.txt
files are created from the originals using the
convert_highschoolfriendship_directed_network_to_pajek_ALAAMEE_format.R
R script which uses the igraph library. (output saved in
convert_highschoolfriendship_directed_network_to_pajek_ALAAMEE_format.out
to facilitate converting integer sex and class attributes back to original
if needed).

highschool_friendship_binattr.txt has 1 for male, created from
highschool_friendship_catattr.txt with:

cat highschool_friendship_catattr.txt | awk '{if (NR == 1) {print "male"} else {if ($2 == "NA") {print 0} else {print $2 - 1}}}' > highschool_friendship_binattr.txt

highschool_friendship_class2BIO3.txt is a binary attribute with 1 for in
class '2BIO3' created with:

cat highschool_friendship_catattr.txt | awk '{if (NR == 1) {print "2BIO3"} else {if ($1 == 3) {print 1} else {print 0}}}' > highschool_friendship_class2BIO3.txt


Results for ALAAM estimation with male as outcome attribute should look 
something like this (from MPNet):
